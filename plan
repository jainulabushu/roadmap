That’s great — you already have the foundation! 🚀
Now, to **level up from basic HTML, CSS, and JS to real website development**, here’s a clear step-by-step roadmap:

---

### ✅ Step 1: Strengthen Core Skills

* **Advanced HTML & CSS**

  * Learn **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** (for layouts)
  * Practice **responsive design** (using media queries)
  * Get comfortable with **CSS variables** and **pseudo-classes** (`:hover`, `:nth-child`)

* **JavaScript**

  * Learn about **DOM manipulation** (you probably know some)
  * Understand **ES6+ features** (like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, promises)
  * Practice **fetch API** (to get data from APIs)
  * Learn **modules** (using `import`/`export`)

---

### ✅ Step 2: Version Control

* Learn **Git** and **GitHub**

  * How to commit, push, pull
  * Create repositories
  * This is essential for real projects!

---

### ✅ Step 3: Build Projects (Start Small)

* Make real **web pages**: portfolio site, restaurant site, product landing page
* Build simple **interactive apps**:

  * Calculator
  * To-do list
  * Weather app (using an API)

---

### ✅ Step 4: Learn a Front-End Framework

* **React.js** (most popular)

  * Components, props, state
  * Hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`)
  * Routing with `react-router`

  *(Optional alternatives: Vue.js or Angular — but React is king now)*

---

### ✅ Step 5: Learn Back-End (Optional but powerful)

* **Node.js** + **Express** (for server-side)
* **MongoDB** (for database)

  * This combo is called the **MERN stack** (Mongo, Express, React, Node)

---

### ✅ Step 6: Learn Deployment

* Deploy your websites using:

  * **GitHub Pages** (simple static sites)
  * **Vercel** or **Netlify** (for React apps)
  * **Heroku** or **Render** (for full-stack apps)

---

### ✅ Step 7: Keep Building and Learning

* Make a **portfolio** site showing your projects.
* Apply for **freelance** projects or internships.
* Optionally, learn **TypeScript** (for better JS coding).
